The following libraries are used by Pony Express and are not part of it's 
source control. They therefore need to be installed seperately as per the instructions 
below. If any of these instructions could be improved please do so!

android-filechooser (version 5.0.)  http://code.google.com/p/android-filechooser/

Download the code and unpack it into a libs directory under your Eclipse 
workspace directory.
ie: ../Workspace/libs/android-filechooser where PonyExpress is in ../Workspace/PonyExpress.
The project properties expect it to be in this location. 

I followed these instructions http://code.google.com/p/android-filechooser/wiki/QuickUse to set it up, 
but some of that is under source control, ie: AndroidManifiest and project.properties so you shouldn't 
have to do much more.
